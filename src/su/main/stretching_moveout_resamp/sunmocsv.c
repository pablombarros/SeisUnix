/* Credits:
 *	SEP: Shuki Ronen, Chuck Sword
 *	CWP: Shuki Ronen, Jack, Dave Hale, Bjoern Rommel
 *      Modified: 08/08/98 - Carlos E. Theodoro - option for lateral offset
 *      Modified: 07/11/02 - Sang-yong Suh -
 *	  added "upward" option to handle decreasing velocity function.
 *      CWP: Sept 2010: John Stockwell
 *	  1. replaced Carlos Theodoro's fix 
 *	  2. added  the instruction in the selfdoc to use suazimuth to set 
 *	      offset so that it accounts for lateral offset. 
 *        3. removed  Bjoren Rommel's anisotropy stuff. sunmo_a is the 
 *           version with the anisotropy parameters left in.
 *        4. note that scalel does not scale the offset field in
 *           the segy standard.
 *        Modified Sept 2021: Andre Latour   
 *	  1. added 3D option (bilinear interpolation of velocity functions).
 *           This is activated by input of a 3D grid definition.                   
 *           See the SUBINCSV program for grid definition details.
