"    Part of using Relational files (like SPS X-file) is similar to using  ",

"    called the field record number (fldr). Its values from the header are ", 
"    then searched for in the X-records using the field with the same name.",
"    But usually multiple X-records match each fldr number. For instance,  ", 
"    for a split-spread 2D, you should expect 2 X-records for each fldr.   ", 
"    These 2 X-records describe which channels are on which receiver points", 
"    for each particular shot. For 3D surveys, there are often 10 or so    ", 
"    X-records for each fldr. For example, a fldr may record 2400 traces   ",
"    with the recording geophone layout pattern extending over 10 receiver ",
"    lines with 240 receiver points each. The next fldr will usually also  ", 
"    record 10 lines by 240 points each, but they may be a different set   ",

"    have _cf _ct _ci to identify them. Similarly, the from,to receiver    ", 
"    point names are seen in example above (60_gaps_rf_69,70_gaps_rt_79).  ", 
"    Notice also the names match1 and matche1 in the X-file name list. This", 
"    means substitute this with the corrasponding name from the match= list", 
"    (with matche1 meaning the name on the end of the match list).         ", 
"    This facility exists because values like field record numbers do not  ",

"    Part of using Relational files (like SPS X-file) is similar to using  ",
"    simpler text files. Relational records have values which match one or ", 
"    more key values from the input trace header. Usually this is something",
"    called the field record number (fldr). Its values from the header are ", 
"    then searched for in the X-records using the field with the same name.",
"    But usually multiple X-records match each fldr number. For instance,  ", 
"    for a split-spread 2D, you should expect 2 X-records for each fldr.   ", 
"    These 2 X-records describe which channels are on which receiver points", 
"    for each particular shot. For 3D surveys, there are often 10 or so    ", 
"    X-records for each fldr. For example, a fldr may record 2400 traces   ",
"    with the recording geophone layout pattern extending over 10 receiver ",
"    lines with 240 receiver points each. The next fldr will usually also  ", 
"    record 10 lines by 240 points each, but they may be a different set   ", 
"    of 10 lines and a differnt set of 240 points. So, SUGEOMCSV program   ", 
"    must read a fldr AND a channel number from the input trace header.    ", 
"    The channel number allows the SUGEOMCSV program to determine which of ", 
"    the 10 X-records to use for that input trace because each of the      ", 
"    10 X-records contains a channel range (from,to,increment). Each of    ", 
"    the 10 X-records also has a receiver point range (from,to). These two ", 
"    ranges allow computation of the specific receiver point number        ", 
"    corresponding to the channel number from the trace header.            ", 
"    The from,to,increment channel names are seen in the X-record examples ", 
"    above (39_matche1_cf_43,44_matche1_ct_48,49_matche1_ci_49) and need to", 
"    have _cf _ct _ci to identify them. Similarly, the from,to receiver    ", 
"    point names are seen in example above (60_gaps_rf_69,70_gaps_rt_79).  ", 
"    Notice also the names match1 and matche1 in the X-file name list. This", 
"    means substitute this with the corrasponding name from the match= list", 
"    (with matche1 meaning the name on the end of the match list).         ", 
"    This facility exists because values like field record numbers do not  ", 
"    always end up in the fldr SU key in input trace headers. Similarly,   ", 
"    values like channel number do not always end up in the tracf SU key.  ",
"    Substitutions allow you to specify a more generic setup for X-files   ",
