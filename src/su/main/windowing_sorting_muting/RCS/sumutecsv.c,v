 *	 1. This program started as a copy of sunmocsv.c which itself
 * 	    started from sunmo.c (yes, NMO). The reason to do this is    
 *	    that sumute.c just has input parameters of tmute[],xmute[].     
 *	    For 3d muting, this program needs  cdp[], tims[][], offs[][].
 *          And, as it happens, sunmocsv.c has cdp[], tnmo[][], vnmo[][]. 
 *          So the easiest thing was to start from sunmocsv.c and 
 *	    rename input parameters. Parts of sumute.c were then copied
 *	    into this program (the code for ntaper= and mode=0,1,2,3).       
 *	    The mode=4 option/code was not copied to here since it does  
 *	    not seem to make sense combined with bilinear interpolation
 *	    of CDP mute function locations (but I could be wrong).          
 *	 2. Changed to expect milliseconds for all parameter inputs.               
 *	 3. Put in error checks to stop users from accidentally         
 *	    trying to use sumute parameter names.
