SUPADMISSING - Add Dead Traces For Missing Key Values.            

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The tests below creates a fake cdp-stack with just a few cdps.
  Then suwind is used to delete some selected cdps.            
  Then supadmissing is used to pad (add back) those missing cdps.    
  The padded traces have the missing cdp numbers.          
  The padded traces have zero amplitude and key nhs=0      
  The padded traces have all other key values copied from the 
  next higher input trace (or the last input trace). No interpolation.

  The header prints and trace plots allow easier checking.        
  For best testing, alter the suwind parameters to delete various cdps.

  In particular, test random small gaps with small amounts of input cdps 
  between the gaps. Also put those random gaps near the beginning and ending
  of the input cdp range.
