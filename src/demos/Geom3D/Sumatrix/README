
SUMATRIX - Assemble a Matrix of Trace Sample Zones.          
 
 The scripts in this directory are designed to test the parameters.
 Notice that the input fake seismic is just 1 flat horizon.

 Once the fake seismic is created, varying the options in test2d and test3d.
 

 Sometime near the end of 2024 I will produce a YouTube video about all this.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Sumatrix_create_simple2d    Must be run first to make fake 2d seismic.

sh ./Sumatrix_test2d

---

sh ./Sumatrix_create_simple3d    Must be run first to make fake 3d seismic.

sh ./Sumatrix_test3d
