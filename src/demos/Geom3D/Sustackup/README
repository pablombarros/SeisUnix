
SUSTACKUP - Input Any Trace Order and Stack To Any Key Combination.      
 
By default this program inputs any trace order and makes a cdp stack  
using all input traces. But this program can also make other stacks.  
Stacks can be made for any user-specified combination of key values.  
All input traces with the same set of key values are stacked together.
In particular, 2D and 3D shot or receiver stacks can be made.         
Additionally, two range limits can be specified to exclude traces     
from stacking. For instance, the offset range can be limited. Range   
limiting can also be done by suwind, of course. But an important      
difference here is that, by default, this program outputs a zero      
amplitude trace with full header values even when the range limits    
exclude all traces for that shot or receiver.

  Basically you should run the scripts in the following order since
  previous output is used for subsequent input and various comparisons.
  These scripts contain information about their purpose.
