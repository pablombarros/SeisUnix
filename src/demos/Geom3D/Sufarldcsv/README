
SUFARLDCSV - Floating Approximate Robust Local Datum From Q-files. 
 
 
  The sufarldcsv program runs the same algorithms for 2D or 3D.
  It is intended to produce a smooth floating datum at 2D cdps or 3D cdps.
  The primary user-adjustment should be the avrad parameter which controls 
  the radial distance within which to average shot and receiver statics
  around each cdp AND also enables an edge-compensation algorithm.                           
  Once avrad has produced averaged shot,receiver values at each cdp, the 
  navrg and nsmth parameters allow further averaging,smoothing of those values
  along the inline cdps (and crossline if 3D).
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following scripts produce maps of shots, receivers, 3D cdp XY locations.    
The first script uses the csv files containing all shots and all receivers.             
The second script uses csv files that have missing shots and missing receivers.             
(the l2rallr2.csv receiver file is not mapped since it only has big change                
 at 2 receiver statics,elevations VALUES and therefor MAPs same as l2rall.csv).                    

sh ./Sufarldcsv_3d_mapa

sh ./Sufarldcsv_3d_mapb

sh ./Sufarldcsv_create1             Need to run this before the tests below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general you should vary the sufarldcsv parameters within the following 
scripts and see what happens in the plots.                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following scripts use the input q-files containing all shots and receivers.
They plot and apply the averaged,smoothed statics output by sufarldcsv 
( test5 is for shots, test6 is for receivers, test7 is for (shot+receiver)/2 ).

sh ./Sufarldcsv_3d_test5        

sh ./Sufarldcsv_3d_test6

sh ./Sufarldcsv_3d_test7

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now some 2D tests (yes, I recommend running the previous 3D tests first).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Sufarldcsv_2d_test8        

sh ./Sufarldcsv_2d_test9        

sh ./Sufarldcsv_2d_test0
