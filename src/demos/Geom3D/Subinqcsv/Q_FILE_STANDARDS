Q-file and q-record standards. Dec 2021.  

   Example A:

   C_SU_SETID,Q
   C_SU_FORMS
   C_SU_ID,%.20g,%.20g,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f
   C_SU_NAMES
   C_SU_ID,cdp,numa,tims,vels,tims,vels
   Q,1,17,0.00,1500.00,500.00,2000.0,1200.00,2500.00,1600.00,3300.00
   Q,7,14,0.00,1555.00,400.00,1990.0,1700.00,3500.00
   Q,12,24,0.00,1435.00,444.00,1555.0,1777.00,3600.00,,,,,,


 1. Q-files are comma-seperated-values files.

 2. Header records starting with C_SU_ preceed all records starting with Q.

 3. The first 3 records above are optional. But some q-files can be input 
    to sugeomcsv and sutoolcsv programs, which require those 3 records. 
    The record after C_SU_FORMS must start with C_SU_ID and then contain
    c-language formats for floating point numbers.

 4. The record containing the names must be the record after C_SU_NAMES
    and must start with C_SU_ID before the first comma.

 5. The comma-location of the names must match the comma-location of  
    their values on the q-records.    
    So, in Example A, the cdp on the first q-record has a value of 1, 
    whereas numa has a value of 17.

 6. Tuples are identified by repeating their names on the record containing
    the names. In Example A, this is: tims,vels,tims,vels
    Tupled names only need to be duplicated once on the record containing
    the names. That is: tims,vels,tims,vels even though there are 4 sets of
    time-velocity pairs on the first q-record and 3 sets of time-velocity pairs
    on the second q-record.

 7. Tupled values occur after all single values and there are no single values 
    after tupled values.                                                        

 8. Tupled names and their values can be singlets, pairs, triplets and so on.
    But tupled names and values do not need to exist. 

 9. Other than the Q, values on q-records must be numbers.
    Blanks between commas on q-records are assumed to be zero unless they
    occur continuously at the end of the q-record, in which case they are
    assumed to mean non-existance (tuple input stops at previous non-blank).

   Example B:

   C_SU_SETID,Q
   C_SU_FORMS
   C_SU_ID,%.20g,%.20g,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f
   C_SU_NDIMS,tims,,0,100,200,300,400,500
   C_SU_NAMES
   C_SU_ID,cdp,cdpt,vels,vels,vels,vels,vels,vels
   Q,21,1,1200.00,1621.05,2076.92,2846.15,3615.38,4142.86
   Q,41,1,1800.00,2694.74,3519.23,3711.54,3903.85,4142.86
   Q,81,1,1800.00,2694.74,3519.23,3711.54,3903.85,4142.86


10. Q-files also have a variant that contains a C_SU_NDIMS record.
    This variant can be used for situations such as Example B where all
    cdps have the same number of velocity values and the set of times
    for those velocities are the same for each cdp. 

11. When a C_SU_NDIMS record is used, the name of the independent dimension
    value is put after the first comma on that record (tims, in Example B).
    
12. When a C_SU_NDIMS record is used, the independent dimension values 
    are put in the same comma-location as the values they refer to.    
    In Example B, this means that tims=0 occurs at the same comma as
    the first vels in the q-records.

   Example C:

   C_SU_SETID,Q
   C_SU_FORMS
   C_SU_ID,%.20g,%.20g,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f,%.2f
   C_SU_NDIMS,tupa,,100,100,500,500
   C_SU_NAMES
   C_SU_ID,cdp,cdpt,dpth,vels,dpth,vels
   Q,1,1,230.00,1534.70,340.00,1823.14
   Q,7,1,233.00,1588.30,356.00,1815.28


13. When a C_SU_NDIMS record is used, and there are pairs or triplets 
    (or more) of values in each q-record, then the independent dimension 
    values are duplicated in the C_SU_NDIMS record as in Example C.
    In other words, the associated independent dimension value is always 
    at the same comma-location as its related values in the q-records. 
       
Note: The reason for the C_SU_NDIMS record standards becomes obvious if
      you look at the q-file in a Spreadsheet. You will see that each
      tupled value in the q-records gets its correct independent dimension 
      value at the top of the column.

Things that are not Q-file standards:

 The subinqcsv program employs q-files and has some restrictions and options.
 To clarify things:

  a. There is no difference between 2d and 3d as far as q-files are concerned.
     But subinqcsv automatically populates some 3d grid names and values into
     its output q-files.

  b. The subinqcsv program requires the independent dimension to be
     in increasing order (the times in time-velocity pairs must increase).
     That is checked by subinqcsv itself. But q-files do not care about that.

  c. By default, subinqcsv automatically assumes that names starting with v
     are velocities and uses inverse-square-VALUE-weighting just like is 
     done within sunmocsv. But q-files do not care about that.

  d. It may be tempting to think of q-files containing C_SU_NDIMS records as 
     output q-files, and not containing C_SU_NDIMS records as input q-files.
     But this is not true, it is just the usual situation for subinqcsv.
