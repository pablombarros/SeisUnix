
SURESCSV - Surface Consistent Residual Statics Determination.   
 
   Derives surface-consistent residual statics for sources and receivers.
   There is one static value estimated for each identified source and    
   one static value estimated for each identified receiver.              

   Notes about tests:

    1. sstat and gstat from l2slong.csv and l2rlong.csv contain shifts 
       that are applied... so that surescsv has some statics to derive.
       Note that sstat,gstat in trace headers are rounded to integer.
    2. sugeomcsv creates the traces and sets scalco and scalel to -10
       so the sx,sy,gx,gy and selev,gelev in headers are 10 times their
       values in l2slong.csv and l2rlong.csv
    3. half of fake input survey deliberatly has bad NMO velocity in test3,4,5.
    4. suchw and sustatic are used in test4 and test5 to create a slanted
       and undulating situation. This is VERY crude forward modelling that
       is intended to be structural dip. Remember that surescsv is NOT intended
       to remove dip. Thus the slant and undulations should NOT be removed 
       by surescsv. Any long (spatial) wavelength statics should be removed
       by elevation/refraction static programs or other statics techniques.
       Surescsv is only intended to derive short (spatial) frequency statics.
       The slant and undulations tests are intended to show that surescsv 
       derives the correct high-frequency statics anyway.
    5. Statics from surescsv are output in Q-files and are easiest to apply 
       using sushiftcsv (which was written contemporaneously, Aug 2023).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Surescsv_create_simple2dstat     Run first to create fake 2D seismic.

sh ./Surescsv_test1

sh ./Surescsv_test2

sh ./Surescsv_test3

sh ./Surescsv_test4

sh ./Surescsv_test5

---

sh ./Surescsv_create_simple3dstat     Run first to create fake 3D seismic.

sh ./Surescsv_test8

sh ./Surescsv_test9
