
SUNSZONECSV - Near Surface Zone Extract and Shift.              
 
 The scripts in this directory are designed to test the parameters.
 They are not realistic tests.                                                   
 Notice that the input fake seismic is just 1 flat horizon.
 For 4 refraction layers, actual seismic should contain up to 4 refraction
 wavelets which cross-over each other at various offset distances, times.

 The SUNSZONECSV program can be used either to help check simple near surface
 models, or for checking geometry update (are XYs correct, have traces been 
 assigned to the correct points/stations). 
 Sometime near the end of 2024 I will produce a YouTube video about all this.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Sunszonecsv_create_simple2dstat   Must be run first to make fake seismic.

sh ./Sunszonecsv_test1

sh ./Sunszonecsv_test2

sh ./Sunszonecsv_test3

sh ./Sunszonecsv_test4

 Note: To make l2scrookred files for tests, start by running the following.
       Then use spreadsheet (I use libreOffice Calc) or other editor to add
       near-surface model values (thicknesses and velocities) for tests 1-4.   
       See my YouTube videos about using spreadsheets and q-files.             

sh ./Sunszonecsv_SPS_Stocsv
