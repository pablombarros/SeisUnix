
SUSHIFTCSV - Apply Static Shifts From Nearest Q-file Records.   
 
 The scripts in this directory are designed to tests the parameters.
 For more realistic tests, see ../Surescsv which produces surface-consistent 
 residual statics for fake traces of complete 2D and 3D seismic surveys.
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I advise running the scripts in the following order:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh ./Sushiftcsv_create1         Must be run first to make fake seismic.

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test1

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test2

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test3

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test4

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test5

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test6

sh ./Sushiftcsv_test7
