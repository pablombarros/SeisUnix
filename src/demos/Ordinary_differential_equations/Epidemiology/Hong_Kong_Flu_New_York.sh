# SIR model

# Important quantities:						
# r0 = number of new infections per single infected host  	
#  1 < r0 < 1.5 for influenza, (2.2 to 2.7 for Covid-19), 12 to	
# 18 for measles.						
#  b, k, S0, and r0 are related via				
#  k = bS0/r0 = b/r0 when S0/N and S0=N 			
#  								
#  It is often easier to determine the recovery rate k (in units
#  of h and to determine reasonable estimate of S0 and of r0 	
#  and to calculate the infection rate b = kr0/S0 or b=kr0	
#  when S0=N and is normalized by N.				
#								
# S = total number susceptible to the infection			
# I = total number of those capable of passing on the infection	
# R = total number removed = dead + recovered			
#								
# When xi is nonzero, then there is a potential that fraction of 
# the removed population can be reinfected.			
#
# When mu>0 and nu>0 birth and death occur.
# 
#  The SRI model describes an epidemic in terms of
#    S = susceptibles in a population
#    I = infectives in a population
#    R = removed = recovered + dead
# 
#    s0 = initial value of the susceptibles
#    i0 = initial value of the infectives
#    r0 = initial removed value = 0
#    
#    s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = r0 + r0   = N for the unnormalized case.
#    If normalized by total population N, then s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1 
#    and s(t) starts at its maxium value of s0/N, if normalization.   
#    
#    R0 = bS0/k  = basic reproduction rate
#    b = rate of infection
#    k = rate removal = recovery rate + death rate
#    xi = re-infection rate 
#    mu = birth rate  
#    nu = death rate
#     
#    The encounters between susceptibles and the infectives is represented
#    by the product  s*i 
# 
#   SIR model:   (Here ' = d/dt )
# 	s'(t) =  - b*s(t)*i(t) 
# 	i'(t) = b*s(t)*i(t)- k*i(t)
# 	r'(t) = k*i(t) 
# 
#   SIR model with Baker 2020 social distancing:  
# 	s'(t) =  - b*s*i/(1 + gamma*i) 
# 	i'(t) = b*s*i/(1 + gamma*i) - k*i 
# 	r'(t) = k*i 
#     
#   SIR model with vital dynamics (mu birth rate, nu death rate):  
# 	s'(t) = mu - nu*s - b*s*i 
# 	i'(t) = b*s*i - k*i - nu*i 
# 	r'(t) = k*i -  nu*r
# 
#   SIRS model with vital dynamics (mu birth rate, nu death rate),
#    and xi reinfection:  
# 	s'(t) = mu - nu*s + xi*r - b*s*i 
# 	i'(t) = b*s*i - k*i - nu*i 
# 	r'(t) = k*i - xi*r - nu*r
# 
#  s(t)= susceptible members 
#  i(t)= infectives
#  r(t)= removed members = recovered + dead + sequestered
# 
#  There is an impiled flow from s(t) -> i(t) -> r(t), though infected
#  who are quarantined immediately become part of R(t). 
# 
#  The product xi*r are the reinfected members of the recovered group,
#  and are thus removed from the recovered group and fed back to the 
#  susceptible group.
#  
#  The product b*s*i denotes the interaction of the infective population with
#  the susceptible population..
