 Notes:							
 This program is really just a demo showing how to use the 	
 differential equation solver rke_solve written by Francois 	
 Pinard, based on a modified form of the 4th order Runge-Kutta 
 method, which employs the error checking method of R. England 
 1969.								

 The output consists of unformated C-style binary floats, of	
 either pairs or triplets as specified by the "mode" paramerter.

 About the SIRD epidemic model:				
 R0 = number of new infections per single infected host  	
  1 < R0 < 1.5 for influenza (2.2 to 2.7 for Covid-19)		
  b, k, s0, and R0 are related via				
  k = b*s0/R0. When s is normalized by N, k=b/R0		
  It is often easier to determine the recovery rate k (in units
  of h and to determine reasonable estimate of s0 and of R0 	
  and to calculate the infection rate b = k*R0/s0, which becomes
  b = k*R0 for s normalized by N.				
  nu= mortality rate						

 S = total number susceptible to the infection			
 I = total number of those capable of passing on the infection	
 R = total number recovered					
 D = total number dead						

 Examples:							
 Default:							
 sird_epidemic | xgraph n=40 nplot=3 d1=1 style=normal &	

 Hypothetical Influenza in a boarding school:			
 N=762 i0=1,  2 students infected per day, 1/2 of the infected	
 population removed per day. Take b=2 k=0.5			
 assume 10% mortality nu=0.1					

 Normalized by N:						
 sird_epidemic h=0.1 stepmax=200 i0=1 b=2 k=.5 nu=.1 N=762 mode=SIRD |
  xgraph n=200 nplot=4 d1=.1 style=normal label1="days"  &	

 Normalized by N, output scaled by N:				
 sird_epidemic h=0.1 stepmax=200 i0=1 b=2 k=.5 nu=.1 N=762 mode=SIRD scale=1 |
  xgraph n=200 nplot=4 d1=.1 style=normal label1="days" &	

 Kong Flu 1968-1969:						
 https://services.math.duke.edu/education/ccp/materials/diffcalc/sir/sir1.html
 Population is N=s0=7.9 million, r0=1.5, the average period of	
 infectiveness is  3 days so k=1/3, b=R0*k=(3/2)(1/3)=0.5, and initial
 infected is i0=10.						

  Normalized by N						
  sird_epidemic h=1 i0=10 stepmax=200 k=.3333 b=.5 N=7.9e6 mode=SIR |	
      xgraph n=200 nplot=3 d1=1 style=normal &			

  Normalized by N, with scaling of the output by N:		
  sird_epidemic h=1 scale=1 i0=10 stepmax=200 k=.3333 b=.5 N=7.9e6 mode=SIR |
      xgraph n=200 nplot=3 d1=1 style=normal &

 The SRI model describes an epidemic in terms of
   S = susceptibles in a population
   I = infectives in a population
   R = recovered
   D = dead

   s0 = initial value of the susceptibles
   i0 = initial value of the infectives
   r0 = initial recovered = usually 0
   d0 = initial dead = usually 0 
   
   S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = s0 + i0  = 1   (normalized by N)
   S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = s0 + i0  = N   (not normalized by N)
   
   r0 = b*s0/k  = basic reproduction rate = b/k when S is normalized by N
   b = rate of infection
   k = rate removal
   nu = mortality rate  
  
   The encounters between susceptibles and the infectives is represented
   by the product S*I  
	S'(t) =  - b*S*I   (S'(t) is always negative)
	I'(t) = b*S*I - k*I - nu*I
	R'(t) = k*I 
	D'(t) = nu*I
 S(t)= susceptible members (no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration)
 I(t)= infective number (includes asymptomatic carriers)
 R(t)= recovered members
 D(t)= dead members

 There is an impiled flow from S(t) -> I(t) -> R(t) or D(t), though infected
 who are quarantined immediately become part of R(t).

 The product b*S*I denotes the interaction of the infective population with
 the susceptible population..
