 VOLTLOTKA -  VOLTerra-LOTKA predator-prey model, modified 	
	        slightly to include a carrying capacity of the  
		prey species						

  voltlotka  > [stdout]					

 Required Parameters: none					
 Optional Parameters:						
 a=0.5			prey increase parameter			
 b=0.02		prey reduction by predation parameter	
 c=0.75		predator reduction rate			
 d=0.005		predator increase by prey capture	

 K=1000000		carrying capacity of prey environment 	
			reduces to classical Volterra-Lotka when
			K >> x and K >> y	

 x0=500		initial number of prey			
 y0=25			initial number of predator		

 thresh=1.0		extinction if x <= thresh or y <= thresh

 h=1.0			step size				
 stepmax=100		maximum number of steps to compute	
 mode=PP		number of Pred. followed by number of Prey
			=R predator only, =Y prey only		
 Notes:							
 This program is really just a demo showing how to use the 	
 differential equation solver rke_solve written by Francois 	
 Pinard, based on a modified form of the 4th order Runge-Kutta 
 method, which employs the error checking method of R. England 
 1969.								

 The output consists of unformated C-style binary floats, of	
 either pairs or triplets as specified by the "mode" paramerter.

 Modified Volterra-Lotka equations: 					
 dx/dt = a*x*(1 - x/K) - b*x*y					
 dy/dt = -c*y + p*x*y						

 x = number of members of the prey species			
 y = number of members of the predator species 		
 bxy = prey population reduction due to predation		
 pxy = predator population increase due due to predation	
 a = prey increase parameter (prey have unlimited food)	
 c = predator reduction (predators starve without prey)	
 K = carrying capacity of for the prey specie, when K large	
     (1 - x/K)-> 1 and the system reduces to original VL system

 Examples:							
 Default: classic Snowshoe hare versus Canadian lynx		
 voltlotka | xgraph n=100 nplot=2 d1=1 style=normal &		

 Caveat: if there is weird behavior, try reducing the h= value
