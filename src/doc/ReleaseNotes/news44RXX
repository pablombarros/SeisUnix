SU News 45 - 30 April 2023

by John Stockwell

This is the first official release (not an incremental) since 2018.

John Stockwell retired from the Colorado School of Mines effective
1 Jan 2018. He continues to work with Seismic Unix.

if you have questions, or if you want to supply bug fixes or new SU code.

Summer 2018 - Thanks to Dominque Rousset of the University of Pau,
Seismic Unix distributions and other information may be found at
https://wiki.seismic-unix.org

Largest contributers to this release:  Andre Latour and Adnand Bitri.

Update 23 March 2023:
Ongoing issues: The GNU people have separated the tirpc library and include
files from the main part of libgcc. These are now in a developers' package
on many systems called libtirpc.a. The TRPC materials are used for the XDR
part of the installation. There seem to be two stages of this change. The
first stage left the RPC include files in the old location. Releases 
GCC 2.32 and later have removed the rpc files and replaced them with 
a version called tirpc.

In response to this issue I have added a paragraph in select 
$CWPROOT/src/configs/Makefile.config_Linu_... near
lines 40-50.
(begin quote)"
.......
# if the include files  are under  /usr/include/rpc use this for XDR
# whether or not you had to install libtrpc.a
# make sure
XDRFLAG =  -DSUXDR
XDRLFLAGS =
XDRIFLAGS =

# else if you had to install libtirpc and the rpc include files are under
# /usr/include/tirpc/rpc or if you get an error about <types.h> not found,
#  and you want to use XDR, then make sure the next three lines are uncommented
XDRFLAG = -DSUXDR -DSUTIRPC
XDRIFLAGS = -I/usr/include/tirpc/rpc -I/usr/include/tirpc
XDRLFLAGS = -ltirpc

# else if you do not want to use XDR, uncomment the next three lines
#XDRFLAG =
#XDRLFLAGS =
#XDRIFLAGS =

.......
"(end quote)

The tirpc issue has been a bit of a moving target but seems to be
stabilizing now. Eventually all systems that use the gcc compiler will
make this change. 

What's new in SU:

Update: Nov 2021 and again in March 2023 The following items in
src/configs/
	Makefile.config_Linux_x86_64
	Makefile.config_Linux_i686
	Makefile.config_Linux_Ubuntu_20.04
	Makefile.config_Linux_Ubuntu_22.04
	Makefile.config_Linux_Ubuntu
	Makefile.config_Linux_Fedora_32
	Makefile.config_Linux_ARCH
	Makefile.config_MacOSX_Big_Sur
	Makefile.config_MacOSX_Catalina

have been modified with compile time flags to handle the rpc and tirpc issue
discussed above, so you can use XDR without a problem.

Fixes:
A number of // C++ style comments have now been changed to /*... */ style
comments. This used to just give a warning, but now actually breaks the code
under GCC 2.32 and higher releases of the gcc compilter. This and a 
number of other compiler warnings have been silenced.

Many thanks to Dominique Rousset for working on this.

An old issue:
The last tmpnam calls were removed from suedit.c and suxedit.c


I have restructured the mains so that programs are grouped by topic. This should make it easier for users to find specific source codes.

		be propagated to all of the Makefile.config_* and this
                likely takes care of the vzestf.f error as well. 

Sfio/
	Replaced these files with versions from the 2002 release of sfio.

	./src/lib/sfio/Stdio_b/vsprintf.c
	./src/lib/sfio/Stdio_s/stdsprintf.c
        The make sfio should work now.
	 Some people are having difficulty with this version. There is
	a gzipped tarfile of the 15 Sept 2021 version of Sfio. Try that
        one or take the Sfio directory from an older release

As always, many thanks to SU users everywhere for your interest in SU
and for your questions, comments, suggestions, and code fixes..
